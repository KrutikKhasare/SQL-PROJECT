BOOKSTORE SALES ANALYSIS
üìå Project Overview

This project is a Bookstore Sales Analysis using SQL, where I worked with three datasets:

Orders (containing order details and quantities)

Books (containing book details like price, stock, and names)

Customers (containing customer information)

The goal of this project is to extract meaningful insights from the data using advanced SQL queries, focusing on sales trends, customer behavior, and inventory management.

üìÇ Dataset Description

The dataset consists of three tables:

1Ô∏è‚É£ BOOKS Table

2Ô∏è‚É£ CUSTOMERS Table

3Ô∏è‚É£ ORDERS Table

üìä SQL Queries & Insights

1Ô∏è‚É£ Most Frequently Ordered Books

Finds the books that were ordered the most:

SELECT b.book_name, SUM(o.quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM books b
JOIN orders o ON b.book_id = o.book_id
GROUP BY b.book_name
ORDER BY total_quantity DESC;

‚úÖ Insight: Identifies top-selling books.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Stock Remaining After Fulfilling Orders

Calculates how many books are left in stock:

SELECT b.book_name,
(b.stock_quantity - COALESCE(SUM(o.quantity), 0)) AS remaining_stock
FROM books b
LEFT JOIN orders o ON b.book_id = o.book_id
GROUP BY b.book_id, b.book_name, b.stock_quantity;

‚úÖ Insight: Helps in inventory management.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Top 5 Customers Who Ordered the Most Books

Finds the most valuable customers based on total books ordered:

SELECT c.customer_name, SUM(o.quantity) AS total_books_ordered
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_name
ORDER BY total_books_ordered DESC
LIMIT 5;

‚úÖ Insight: Helps in customer segmentation and loyalty programs.

‚úÖ Insight: Helps measure business performance.
